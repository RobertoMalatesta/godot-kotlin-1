# godot-kotlin
Kotlin Native bindings for Godot.

### Status
Work in progress, at the moment the following are possible:

- create shared library and load it in Godot (see [samples/simple](https://github.com/raniejade/godot-kotlin/tree/master/samples/simple))
- Print to Godot's output tab (via `Godot.print`)

**TODO**
- most of built-in types are not implemented
- all of the editor types are not implemented (will be code generated) 
- registering a kotlin class
